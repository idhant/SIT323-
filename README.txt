Follow the below mentioned step to test the validation of the files and their allocations. 

NOTE:Before proceeding, please make sure that all the .taff and .cff files are in the same folder. As the code to locate the .cff file path relies on the path of the .taff file, both should be in the same directory. By Default, the files are already located in the same folder as the solution.

Step-1: Start by selecting a .taff (Task Allocation File Format) file. You can select this file by clicking the "Open .taff File" button or  navigating to the menu bar -> File -> Open. Browse to the file you want to validate and open it.

If the .taff file had a .cff file name in it, it will be extracted. Both the files contents can be seen in their respective section. 
If the files were valid, the heading will turn to green; else the heading will turn to red. Any errors are shown in the errors box.

Step-2: If both the files were valid, the allocations can now be validated by clicking the "Validate Allocations" button or navigating to the menu bar -> Validate -> Allocations. 

The allocation details can be seen in the box. If the allocations were valid, the heading turns to green; else it turns to red. Any errors are shown in the errors box.
